# Vendetta Themes
About the themes I created for Vendetta, a mobile modification of Discord.
You need [Vendetta](https://github.com/vendetta-mod/Vendetta#installing) installed on your device to get the themes work.

## How to install theme:
Copy the raw link for the desired theme and paste it in `Settings -> Vendetta -> Themes -> Plus Sign` to install the theme.

## Oled Blue
